            <div class="paraOfSearching">
                <p>Searching in an array is a common operation in computer science and programming. The basic idea is to
                    look for a specific value or information in a collection of elements stored in an array. There are
                    different techniques and algorithms that can be used to perform this operation, depending on the
                    size of the array, the type of elements, and the requirements of the search.<br>

                    One of the simplest and most commonly used techniques is linear search, also known as sequential
                    search. This involves iterating through the array one element at a time until the target value is
                    found or the end of the array is reached. Linear search is easy to implement and works well for
                    small arrays or for unsorted arrays where the elements are not in any particular order.<br>

                    Another technique is binary search, which is more efficient for larger arrays and sorted arrays.
                    Binary search works by dividing the array in half repeatedly until the target value is found or it
                    is determined that the value is not present in the array. This approach is faster than linear search
                    for large arrays because it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step.</p>

                <p>Sorting an array is another fundamental operation in computer science and programming. The goal of
                    sorting an array is to rearrange its elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.
                    There are many algorithms that can be used to sort an array, each with its own advantages and
                    disadvantages. Here are brief explanations of six popular sorting algorithms : Selection Sort,
                    Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Heap Sort.<br> To visualize Sorting

                    Graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of vertices (also
                    called nodes) and edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to model a wide range of
                    real-world phenomena, such as social networks, transportation systems, and computer networks. Graph
                    traversal is a common operation in graph theory and involves visiting all the vertices and edges of
                    a graph in a systematic way.<br>
                    <b>Breadth-first search</b>: This algorithm visits all the vertices in a graph by exploring all the
                    neighbors of a vertex before moving on to its neighbors' neighbors. In other words, it visits all
                    the vertices at a given distance from the starting vertex before moving on to vertices that are
                    farther away. BFS is implemented using a queue data structure and has a time complexity of O(V+E),
                    where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.<br>
                    <b>Depth-first search</b>: This algorithm visits all the vertices in a graph by exploring as far as
                    possible along each branch before backtracking. In other words, it explores all the vertices along a
                    path before exploring vertices that are farther away. DFS is implemented using a stack data
                    structure and has a time complexity of O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number
                    of edges.

                <p>A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node can have at most two children. The topmost
                    node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes that share the same parent are called siblings.
                    The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node, while the height of a node is
                    the number of edges on the longest path from that node to a leaf node. Binary trees can be traversed
                    in various ways, such as pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Binary trees are commonly
                    used in computer science and programming for various applications, such as searching, sorting, and
                    data compression.

                    A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It consists
                    of a series of elements, and the most recently added element is always placed on top. The order in
                    which elements are added to the stack is reversed when they are removed, with the most recently
                    added element being the first to be removed. Stacks are often used in programming for various
                    applications, such as function call processing, undo/redo operations, and expression evaluation.
                    Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and the time complexity of push and pop
                    operations is O(1) for both implementations.

                    A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It consists
                    of a series of elements, with the first element added to the queue being the first to be removed.
                    Elements are added at the rear end of the queue and removed from the front end. Queues are often
                    used in programming for various applications, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and event
                    processing. Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, and linked-list-based
                    implementations have a constant time complexity of O(1) for both enqueue and dequeue operations.
                    However, array-based implementations may require O(n) time complexity in the worst case when
                    resizing the array. The peek operation returns the value of the front element without removing it
                    from the queue. An overflow occurs when the queue is full and an enqueue operation is attempted,
                    while an underflow occurs when the queue is empty and a dequeue operation is attempted.
